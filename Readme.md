# Nous Digital Task

that task is for an ios developer role 

## Task requirements 

Create an iPhone application in portrait mode with the following requirements. The
the application does not have to follow a set design and should be understood as a
prototype to assess your abilities.


### Ordered List

1. The application should load a JSON from the following URL (https://
cloud.nousdigital.net/s/rNPWPNWKwK7kZcS/download). The JSON includes an
array of objects consisting of an imageURL, a title, and a description.

2. The application should display the corresponding data in a list. An image should be
loaded asynchronously in order to display it in the table cell as well. The cell height
should be dynamic, meaning adapting to the content (please use UIKIT).

3. When a cell is selected, a mail dialog should open, with the title representing
the subject of the mail and the description of the body of the mail.
4. This task should be implemented with RxSwift (Combine is acceptable while you
still need a concrete knowledge of RxSwift).

the description should be used.

6. Bonus: App should perform as well in dark mode as in light mode.
